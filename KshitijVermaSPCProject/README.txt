Dobar Dan/Vece, 

This repository is a culmination of my efforts in Software Components and Patterns,

It contains a Core Folder housing a python setup file and further inside an OperatorBase Abstract Class that sets the guideline for the operators we will as Plugins to our Core Component.

By installing the setup.py files in each Operator folder (Add,Div,Mult,Subtract) we will then be able to utilize the corresponding operator for our desired function.

Class Diagram and Component Diagrams are in the "Diagrams" folder, 

Also included is a short video on the installation and functionality of the Core and each Operator in a Virtual Environtment called "Comptest3"

Sincerely-
